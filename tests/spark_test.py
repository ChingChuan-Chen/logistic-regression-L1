"""
Make sure all of the spark parts work!
Test cases to cover:
    Force same data from convergence tests into spark
    Take input of both list of lists and nparray
    Ensure that the result of `fit` ~= pre-stated betas
    Check that prediction of test data = y / m
    Check betas and intercepts with zeros
    Anything else??
